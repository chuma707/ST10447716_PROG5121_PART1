This program is built using Visual Studio Code, is made to let users sign up and log in.
When a new user signs up, the program asks for their name, a special username, a password, and a cell phone number.
The program checks the information the user enters. It makes sure the username has the right format, the password is strong, and the phone number has a country code. If the user makes a mistake, it lets them fix just that part.
Once a user finishes signing up, they can log in with their new username and password. The program will welcome them if they get it right or show an error message if they get it wrong.
The code is split into two main parts. One part (Login.java) holds all the rules and logic. The other part (Main.java) is what the user sees and interacts with.
I also used Visual Studio Code to run a file(LoginTest.java) that automatically checks all the code to prove that every feature works perfectly.
